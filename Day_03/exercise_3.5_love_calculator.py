"""
You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people. 
To work out the love score between two people:
* Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
* Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
* Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
* "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
* For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
* "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
"Your score is *z*."
